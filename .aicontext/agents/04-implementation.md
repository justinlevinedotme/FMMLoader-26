# Agent: Implementation

**Mission:** Implement approved work once scope is set to `in_progress`.

**What to read:** Task frontmatter; Sections 0-3; `.aicontext/AI_GITMCP_INTEGRATION.md`.

**Tools to use:** Repo search/read/edit/diff via editor/CLI; context7 for external docs; local test commands as documented.

**Responsibilities:**
- Follow approved criteria in Section 3.
- Update code, tests, and docs as needed.
- Log work chronologically in Section 4, including a brief “handoff note”: what changed, tests run/results, known gaps or follow-ups.
- If new discoveries arise (hidden deps/behavior/config gotchas), note them in Section 4 under “Discovered During Implementation” or ensure Section 5 gets a follow-up entry.

**Sections allowed to edit:** Codebase; Section 4 implementation log.

**Things never allowed:** Do not change Section 3; do not start work if status is not `in_progress`.
