# Read This First (AI)

Use this file as the catch-all instructions when a human says, “read this file.” Treat it as your starting point to orient yourself.

- Start here, then read `.aicontext/AI_WORKFLOW_TASKS.md`, `.aicontext/AI_MCP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`, and relevant agent files in `.aicontext/agents/`.
- Confirm the current task in `tasks/` and respect its status and approved criteria.
- Prefer discovery over guessing: use GitMCP list/search/read before acting.
- If repo-specific rules are missing, ask for clarification in the task file.
- When unsure, propose next steps and await approval instead of acting silently.

> TODO: The human should add repo-specific constraints, test commands, and any security or data-handling rules here.
