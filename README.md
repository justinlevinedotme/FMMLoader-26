### The Story
The goal when creating FMMLoader was simple: provide a foolproof and beautiful way to support the modding community in FM26. It has evolved from a simple, python based Tkinter application to a TauriV2 + React based powerhouse. I have used this project to experiment with AI based coding a lot, but have learned a ton along the way.

As a longtime fan of the FM series, it is such a pleasure to share this work and labor of love with the community. Thank you for using it, engaging with it, and helping me improve it.

Created with love by Justin / JALCO

### Feature Overview
- **Drag and Drop Mod Support:** Simply drag your preferred mod in, and the app will handle the rest.
- **Smart Detection:** Supports path detection for your game on any platform (Linux, PC, Gamepass, Mac, Custom Directories)
- **Game-Safe:** FMMLoader has built in restore points, meaning you can feel safe experimenting with mods. Simply create a restore point before adding your mods.
- **Active Development:** FMMLoader is actively being developed, I have put a ton of time into this and it is a labor of love. I am always adding things.
- **Multi-Language:** FMMLoader has recently been translated to Portugese, German, Korean, Turkish, and Italian. Contributing your own language is simple through [CrowdIn](https://crowdin.com/project/fmmlo "CrowdIn").
