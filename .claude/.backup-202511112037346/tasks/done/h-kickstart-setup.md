## Problem/Goal
We need a dummy task to show the user how task-startup and task-completion protocols work.

## Success Criteria
- [x] Finish task startup
- [x] Start task completion

## Context Manifest
Fake context manifest

## Work Log

### 2025-11-11

#### Completed
- Successfully demonstrated DAIC mode switching (Discussion to Implementation and back)
- Created demonstration task (m-implement-fansite-namefix-mod-support) with context-gathering agent
- Completed task startup protocol showing git workflow, branch creation, and context loading
- Demonstrated proposal/approval workflow with dummy todos
- Successfully triggered and demonstrated violation detection when attempting unauthorized todo changes
- Initiated task completion protocol

#### Decisions
- Skipped code-review and service-documentation agents during kickstart demonstration as instructed
- Used kickstart task as hands-on demonstration of task-startup and task-completion protocols

#### Discovered
- All kickstart protocol steps executed successfully
- DAIC enforcement system working correctly (blocked unauthorized todo modifications)
- Context-gathering agent successfully populated comprehensive context manifest for demonstration task

#### Next Steps
- Complete logging agent execution to consolidate work logs
- Mark task as complete and archive
- Continue with remaining kickstart onboarding steps
