FMMLoader-26 Privacy Policy

Last updated: November 17, 2025

FMMLoader-26 is an open-source tool for managing Football Manager mods and graphics.
It is designed to operate locally on the user’s device. The project does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.

⸻

1. Information We Do Not Collect

FMMLoader-26 does not collect or process:
- Personal information
- Usernames, emails, or identifiers
- System information
- Analytics or usage data
- Crash logs or diagnostics
- IP addresses (we do not log or store them)

The app does not include telemetry, tracking, advertising, or analytics of any kind.

⸻

2. Local-Only Operations

All mod routing, file movements, and graphics installations occur entirely on your device.
No information is sent to the developer or any third party outside of the services listed below.

⸻

3. Internet Connections

FMMLoader-26 connects to the internet only to:
- Check for new versions
- Download release metadata (latest.json)
- Download graphics packs or mod files (when the user requests it)

These requests are standard HTTPS requests made directly to GitHub or other download sources the user selects.

FMMLoader-26 does not access, store, intercept, or analyze any information from these requests.

GitHub may log basic connection data (like IP addresses) per their own privacy policy, which is outside of FMMLoader-26’s control.

⸻

4. Third-Party Services

The app may interact with:
- GitHub – for updates and asset downloads
- Content providers – only when the user chooses to download a pack hosted elsewhere

FMMLoader-26 does not share any data with these services. Users are subject to each provider’s privacy policy.

⸻

5. Open-Source Transparency

FMMLoader-26 is fully open source.
All behavior is visible in the source code and can be verified by any user.

⸻

6. Changes to This Policy

If future versions introduce optional telemetry or cloud features, this policy will be updated with full transparency.

7. Contact

For questions or concerns, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.
